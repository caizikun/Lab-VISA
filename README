VISA
====

This library offers a perl interface to National Instrument's NI-VISA library.

With this library you can easily control the instruments in your lab (multimeters, voltage
sources, magnet sources, pulse generators etc.) from perl. You can perform
complicated measurement jobs with just some perl loops.

It comes even better. The general VISA::Instrument class reduces the
communication overhead to a minimum. And the specialized instrument classes
(virtual instruments) like the VISA::Instrument::HP34401A class offer
even more high level comfort. Everything is prepared and waiting for you.


INSTALLATION

This library compiles has been tested on Linux and Windows.

Before you start, you must have the VISA library by National Instrument
installed. If you plan to use GPIB connections (which is very likely), you must also
have the necessary drivers (NI-488.2) for your GPIB adapter card installed. Refer to the good
documentation by National Instrument to find out, how to install these packages.

If you are on Windows, you will need a compiler and the Microsoft make program called
'nmake'. I successfully used the freely available Visual C++ 2005.

To build and install this module, type the following commands. Windows users replace
'make' by 'nmake'.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In case the compiler or linker cannot find certain include files (e.g. visa.h) or libraries,
adjust the platform specific lines in Makefile.PL where indicated.
