Lab::VISA - Perl interface to the National Instruments VISA library


This library offers a Perl interface to National Instruments' NI-VISA library. 
It is one of the possible backends for the high-level measurement control 
package Lab::Measurement, but can also be used on its own.

Lab::VISA is known to work with GPIB, TCP/IP and serial connections. Other 
interfaces supported by the NI-VISA library are likely to work as well. The 
library has been tested on both on Linux and on Windows.

Detailed installation instructions are given in Lab::VISA::Installation.

In case you encounter any problems, you are encouraged to use a public forum for 
discussion. This way future users will be able to take advantage of your findings.

There is a mailing list set up, also for Lab::VISA, at
https://www-mailman.uni-regensburg.de/mailman/listinfo/lab-measurement-users

Bugs can be reported to https://github.com/lab-measurement/Lab-VISA/issues

You will also find that the authors of this package are always happy to receive
feedback.
