=head1 NAME

Lab::VISA - Perl interface to the National Instruments VISA library

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library offers a Perl interface to National Instruments' NI-VISA 
library. 

It is one of the possible backends for the high-level measurement control 
package L<Lab::Measurement>, but can also be used on its own.

L<Lab::VISA> is known to work with GPIB, TCP/IP and serial connections. Other interfaces
supported by the NI-VISA library are likely to work as well. The library
has been tested on both on Linux and on Windows.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Detailed installation instructions are given in L<Lab::VISA::Installation>.

=head1 FURTHER SUPPORT

Bugs can be reported to
